**nichenetr: the R implementation of the NicheNet method.** The goal of NicheNet is to study intercellular communication from a computational perspective. NicheNet integrates expression data of interacting cells with prior information on potential links between ligands and target genes. Hereby, NicheNet can be used to study how one cell (or cell type) influences gene expression in an interacting cell (or cell type). This type of analysis can provide novel functional insights into intercellular signaling processes compared to limiting the analyis to ligand-receptor inference. 

Specific functionalities include: 
* assessing how well ligands expressed by a sender cell can predict changes in gene expression in the receiver cell
* prioritizing ligands based on their effect on gene expression
* inferring putative ligand-target links active in the system under study
* inferring potential signaling paths between ligands and target genes of interest

## Installation of nichenetr

You can install nichenetr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("browaeysrobin/nichenetr")
```
