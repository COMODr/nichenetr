\title{Get active gene regulatory network in a receiver cell.}
\usage{
get_active_regulatory_network(expression_receiver, sig_network, expression_cutoff_receiver = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression_receiver}{A named numeric vector of gene expression levels (absolute or logfc) for the receiver cell that receives extracellular signals from the sender cell}

\item{gr_network}{A data frame / tibble containing gene regulatory interactions (required columns: from, to). Can be both unweighted and weighted.}

\item{expression_cutoff_receiver}{The cutoff on expression value for the receiver cell: receptors will be considered active if their expression is higher than the cutoff. Default: 0.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing at least the variables from, to, receiver_expression. In this network, the active gene regulatory interactions in the system of interest are shown.
}
\description{
\code{get_active_regulatory_network} Get active regulatory network by looking for which TFs/regulatory genes are expressed in the receiver cell. Instead of looking at absolute expression, it is possible as well to extract a gene regulatory network of differentially expressed TFs if a vector of log2 fold change values is used as input.
